# Coffee Shop Website

This repository contains the source code for a simple, responsive coffee shop website. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it showcases a modern and visually appealing design.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to provide a template for a coffee shop's online presence. It includes sections for a menu, product listings, customer reviews, a blog, and contact information. The website is designed to be easily customizable and can be adapted for other similar businesses.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the website.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet that defines the visual appearance of the website.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity to the website, such as toggling navigation menus and search bars.
- `images/`: A directory containing all the images used in the project.

## Setup

No special setup is required to run this project. Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the website.

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/coffee-shop-website.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd coffee-shop-website
    ```
3.  Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.

## Usage

The website is a single-page application with several sections:

- **Home**: A welcoming landing page with a call-to-action.
- **About**: Information about the coffee shop and what makes it special.
- **Menu**: A list of coffee drinks with prices.
- **Products**: A showcase of coffee products available for purchase.
- **Review**: Customer testimonials.
- **Contact**: A contact form and an embedded map.
- **Blogs**: A section for blog posts about coffee.

The navigation bar at the top allows for easy navigation between these sections. The site is also responsive and should adapt to different screen sizes.
